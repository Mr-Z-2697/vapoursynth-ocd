`core.ocd.dct(clip, inverse=0)`    
`core.ocd.gaussianblur(clip, sigmax=1, sigmay=0, sizex=0, sizey=0, bordertype=4)`    

### build
Run ocd.sh    
I only tried mingw    
opencv has so many default enabled 3rd party components which is not needed for this simple plugin turn them off I'm too lazy to write them down ðŸ˜¥
